# RNOW March JPA Warehouse Map

## Introduction

The [Riverside Neighbors Opposing Warehouses (RNOW)](https://sites.google.com/view/rivnow/) March JPA Warehouse Map is a publicly available tool developed to help visualize the development of warehouses around the March Air Reserve Base. This dashboard is largely based off of the [Warehouse CITY](https://radicalresearch.shinyapps.io/WarehouseCITY/) tool developed in collaboration by [Redford Conservancy at Pitzer College](https://www.pitzer.edu/redfordconservancy/) and [Radical Research LLC](http://radicalresearch.llc). That tool allows additional quantification capabilities. The RNOW community group opposes new warehouse development around the Orangecrest and Mission Grove neighborhoods of the City of Riverside. The communities surrounding the March Inland Port area already have the second highest density of warehouse development in the Inland Empire. Over 280 warehouses around March ARB along the 215 corridor cumulatively cover 4873 acres and are estimated to exceed 137 million square feet. We estimate that these warehouses generate about 90,000 truck trips daily.

## Warehouse Authorities around March ARB

Five land-use authorities contribute to the warehouses around the March ARB.

-   City of [Riverside](https://riversideca.gov/) - Over 50 warehouses in the Sycamore Canyon Business Park (\~20M sq.ft.)
-   City of [Moreno Valley](https://moval.gov/index.shtml) - Over 75 warehouse along Cactus Avenue and along Indian Street near the March ARB. (\~39M sq.ft.)
-   City of [Perris](https://www.cityofperris.org/) - Over 75 warehouses along Perris Blvd. and Ramona Expressway (\~44M sq.ft.)
-   [Riverside County](https://rivco.org/) - Over 45 warehouses, mostly alongside the 215 Corridor South of Riverside National Cemetary (\~14M sq.ft.).
-   [March Joint Powers Authority](https://marchjpa.com/) - About 45 warehouses, directly adjacent to March ARB, along Van Buren, and along the 215 Corridor between Alessandro and Van Buren (\~23M sq.ft.).

The March Joint Powers Authority (MJPA) is a quasi-governmental land-use authority that is comprised of [eight commissioners](https://marchjpa.com/about/march-joint-powers-commission/) from the four governmental agencies. Two commissioners are from each of the cities (Moreno Valley, Perris, Riverside) and another two are from the County.

## Map and Data Provenance

The map can be navigated using point, click, and drag features or by clicking on the zoom plus and minus buttons on the top left corner of the map. At the top right of the map, the imagery can be switched between a street level **Basemap** and satellite **Imagery**. Polygon overlays can be turned on or off by selecting the check boxes for **Jurisdictions**, **Existing Warehouses**, **Planned Warehouses**, and **800 foot buffer**.

-   **Jurisdictions**: This shows the boundaries for Moreno Valley, Perris, Riverside, March JPA, and Unincorporated Riverside County. Data were obtained from [RivCo Open Data Cities](https://gisopendata-countyofriverside.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/CountyofRiverside::cities/explore) and [census designated places](https://gisopendata-countyofriverside.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/f84b20601ad84a1e8b6333e5fad041f8_0/about). The March JPA boundary is discontinuous. Note that this dataset was provided as a personal communication with the County of Riverside. As noted by the County - *"The County of Riverside is not the custodian of records for the March Airforce Base Joint Powers Authority and therefore cannot ensure the accuracy of records in its possession that are related to the JPA."* Multiple public records request to the March JPA requesting boundary information were denied as the March JPA *"do not have the requested information available"*.
-   **Existing warehouses**: Data processed using methodology established in Warehouse City tool v1.09. Raw data from [RivCo assessor data](https://gis2.rivco.org/).
-   **Planned Warehouses** - Polygons based on EIR documents from March JPA or City of Riverside.
-   **800 foot buffer**: This is based on the 2020 [City of Riverside Good Neighbor Guidelines](https://riversideca.gov/cedd/sites/riversideca.gov.cedd/files/pdf/planning/2021/Good%20Neighbor%20Guidelines.pdf) and [Title 19 Zoning standards](https://library.municode.com/ca/riverside/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=PTIICOOR_TIT19ZO_ARTVBAZOREUSDEPR_CH19.130INZOBMIAIAI_19.130.030DESTINZO)

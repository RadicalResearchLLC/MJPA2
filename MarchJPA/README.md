# RNOW March JPA Warehouse Map

## Introduction

The [Riverside Neighbors Opposing Warehouses (RNOW)](https://sites.google.com/view/rivnow/) March JPA Warehouse Map is a publicly available tool developed to help visualize and quantify the development of warehouses around the March Air Reserve Base. This dashboard is largely based off of the [Warehouse CITY](https://radicalresearch.shinyapps.io/WarehouseCITY/) tool developed in collaboration by [Redford Conservancy at Pitzer College](https://www.pitzer.edu/redfordconservancy/) and [Radical Research LLC](http://radicalresearch.llc). The RNOW community group opposes new warehouse development around the Orangecrest and Mission Grove neighborhoods of Riverside. The communities surrounding the March Inland Port area already have the second highest density of warehouse development in the Inland Empire. Over 280 warehouses around March ARB along the 215 corridor cumulatively cover 4873 acres and are estimated to exceed 137 million square feet.  We estimate that these warehouses generate close to 90,000 truck trips daily.

## Warehouse Authorities around March ARB

Five land-use authorities contribute to the warehouses around the March ARB. 

* City of [Riverside](https://riversideca.gov/) - Over 50 warehouses in the Sycamore Canyon Business Park (~20M sq.ft.)
* City of [Moreno Valley](https://moval.gov/index.shtml) - Over 75 warehouse along Cactus Avenue and along Indian Street near the March ARB. (~39M sq.ft.)
* City of [Perris](https://www.cityofperris.org/) - Over 75 warehouses along Perris Blvd. and Ramona Expressway (~44M sq.ft.)
* [Riverside County](https://rivco.org/) - Over 45 warehouses, mostly alongside the 215 Corridor South of Riverside National Cemetary (~14M sq.ft.).  
* [March Joint Powers Authority](https://marchjpa.com/) - About 45 warehouses, directly adjacent to March ARB, along Van Buren, and along the 215 Corridor between Alessandro and Van Buren (~23M sq.ft.).

The March Joint Powers Authority (MJPA) is a quasi-governmental land-use authority that is comprised of [eight commissioners](https://marchjpa.com/about/march-joint-powers-commission/) from the four governmental agencies. Two commissioners are from each of the cities (Moreno Valley, Perris, Riverside) and another two are from the County. 

## Map and Data Provenance

The map can be navigated using point, click, and drag features or by clicking on the zoom plus and minus buttons on the top left corner of the map. At the top right of the map, the imagery can be switched between a street level **Basemap** and satellite **Imagery**. Polygon overlays can be turned on or off by selecting the check boxes for **City boundaries**, **MJPA boundary**, **Existing warehouses**, **Under construction warehouses**, **West Campus Upper Plateau**, **800 foot buffer - City policy**, and **1000 foot buffer - WRCOG GNG**. 

* City boundaries - This shows the city borders for the Cities of Moreno Valley, Perris, and Riverside as a blue line. Data obtained from [RivCo Open Data Cities](https://gisopendata-countyofriverside.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/CountyofRiverside::cities/explore)  
* MJPA boundary - This shows the March JPA boundary as a black line.  It is discontinuous. Note that this was provided from a personal communication with the County of Riverside.  As noted by the County - _"The County of Riverside is not the custodian of records for the March Airforce Base Joint Powers Authority and therefore cannot ensure the accuracy of records in its possession that are related to the JPA."_ Multiple public records request to the March JPA requesting boundary information were denied due as they _"do not have the requested information available"_.
* Existing warehouses - Data processed using methodology established in Warehouse City tool v1.09. Raw data from [RivCo assessor data](https://gis2.rivco.org/).
* Under construction warehouses - Polygons based on EIR documents from land-use authority
* West Campus Upper Plateau - Polygons based on this ![April 25, 2022 release proposal map](https://marchjpa.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/04252022_21039-00-A1-14-DimSetbacks.jpg).
* 800 foot buffer is based on the 2020 [City of Riverside Good Neighbor Guidelines](https://riversideca.gov/cedd/sites/riversideca.gov.cedd/files/pdf/planning/2021/Good%20Neighbor%20Guidelines.pdf) and [Title 19 Zoning standards](https://library.municode.com/ca/riverside/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=PTIICOOR_TIT19ZO_ARTVBAZOREUSDEPR_CH19.130INZOBMIAIAI_19.130.030DESTINZO)   
* 1000 foot buffer is based on the 2005 Western Riverside Council of Governments [Good Neighbor Guidelines](https://wrcog.us/DocumentCenter/View/318/Good-Neighbor-Guidelines-for-Siting-Warehouse-Distribution-Facilities-PDF?bidId=) previously adopted by March JPA for routing truck trips  in Ordinance [#JPA 17-06](https://www.marchjpa.com/documents/docs_forms/01132022_JPA_21-02_Truck_Route_Ordinance_11-21.pdf). _"Whereas in February 2018, the Commission adopted #JPA 17-06, updating the truck routes to include newly constructed streets within the north campus and south campus of the March Business Center and Meridian developments and implementing the objectives of the 'Good Neighbor Guidelines for Siting New and/or Modified Warehouse/Distribution Facilities" distributed and promoted by the WRCOG"_.
